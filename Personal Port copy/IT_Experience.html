  <p>I'm currently studying at Wake Tech and have been here for almost 3 full semesters. I won't say my progress has been the best, but it hasn't been the worst either. I've learned a lot of things and how I need to better manage my time and efforts into my classes. Since most of the in-person classes I want to take fill up quickly, I often have to take my classes online. It's not bad unless it's Web Design; for some reason, things just don't click as fast for me in that class.</p>
