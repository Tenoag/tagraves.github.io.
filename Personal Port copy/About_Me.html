  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is Tenoa, and I am a current student at Wake Tech studying Cyber Security.</p>

  <p>My passion is within the technology field and IT. It has its ups and downs as technology rapidly changes, making it hard to find where you fit in, but I make it work.</p>

  <p>Originally, I was born in Mississippi, but sadly my mother and I got caught in the middle of Hurricane Katrina, which took a lot of what we had. So since we no longer have a home, we moved up here to North Carolina, where I'd eventually be staying. As I grew up, a lot of what my parents gave me to entertain myself were tablets or phones because I didn't have much interest in toys. However, my interest in technology didn't really spark until over break in middle school. There was a group I got signed up for which involved coding a program for the Sphero balls to go through an obstacle course to present to big businesses/corporations.</p>
  
  <p>While I participated in that, I had a lot of fun, and I was able to quickly understand how the programming for the Spheros worked. Ever since then, the idea of coding or designing something stuck with me. I eventually took coding classes in high school and tried to learn extra when I had free time at home, but I couldn't stay focused for long when I did.</p>
