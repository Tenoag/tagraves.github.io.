<h2>Welcome to my personal portfolio website! </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>	A little more about me is I am passionate in the IT field and want to share my skills, experiences, and projects with you. I'm still pretty new to college and have my ups and downs with it. I constantly try to widen my knowledge to the best of my ability. Through this website, I aim to showcase my abilities, highlight my achievements, and provide insights into my journey into IT/cybersecurity.	</p>
<p>&nbsp; As you scroll and look through the pages of this portfolio, you'll see parts of my previous work, learn more about me, and other things as well. I'm still have pretty basic in knowledge of building a site so excuse the lack luster of cool formatting. </p>
