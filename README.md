2.	This is my github account they I've had for a while but will be used for others to review my code and possibly either give adivce I can take to better my site.
3.	My respritory contains all the images, code, as well as my CCS files that I;ve used to build my personal portfoio 
4.	To clone my respritory was fairly simple. I made a copy of the folder I had already had in Dreamweaver to build my site and moved that copy to the clone respitory here.
That way any comments I might get on my code here I can go back into dreamweaver to possibily correct or edit without causing any confusion within the folders and files I already have made.
